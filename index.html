  <h2>Cat Behaviour</h2>
<p>Kids may say the darndest things, but it’s felines that really throw us for a loop with their odd cat behavior! From kneading on soft blankets to knocking things off tables to scratching our brand-new furniture, they tend to induce an equal amount of “awws!” and “oh no’s!” This cat behavior guide breaks down all the above and more, so keep reading. You’ll also want to read up on why cats love boxes, why cats hate water, and why cats purr. Check out this guide to cat body language to see what your feline is trying to tell you. Also, find out if cats get jealous.</p>
